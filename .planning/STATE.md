# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-09)

**Core value:** Numerically accurate (energy relative error <= 10^-12 vs libxc oracle) evaluation of all 649 XC functionals from a single pure-Rust codebase that runs on both CPU and GPU without code duplication.
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — Foundation and Registry

## Current Position

Phase: 01 (Foundation and Registry) — EXECUTING
Plan: 1 of 3
Status: Executing Phase 01
Last activity: 2026-04-08 -- Phase 01 execution started

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- None yet.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 2 is the key technical risk gate: CubeCL must produce bit-accurate f64 results for LDA_X canary kernel before bulk translation begins
- CubeCL lacks erf/erfc and cbrt intrinsics -- must be implemented as pure #[cube] functions
- Large MGGA kernels (50K-100K lines) may exceed GPU compiler limits -- test early in Phase 4
